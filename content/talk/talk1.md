title = "Reconstructing gene regulatory networks from DNA methylation and transcriptome profiles"
abstract = "DNA methylation has been used to identify functional changes at transcriptional enhancers and other cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in tumors and other disease tissues. Our R/Bioconductor package ELMER (Enhancer Linking by Methylation/Expression Relationships) provides a systematic approach that reconstructs altered gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by combining enhancer methylation and gene expression data derived from the same sample set. ELMER uses methylation changes at CRMs as the central hub of these networks, using correlation analysis to associate them with both upstream master regulator (MR) transcription factors and downstream target genes."
abstract_short = "In this talk we present ELMER v.2, which provides numerous new features including a new Supervised Analysis mode to use pre-defined sample groupings. Using Breast cancer as a case of study, we show that this approach can identify GRNs associated with many new Master Regulators. Finally, ELMER is being applied to several GDAN projects."
